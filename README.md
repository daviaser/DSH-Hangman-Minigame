# DSH-Hangman-Minigame
# Hi there!!
Welcome to the Hangman Minigame Project.
This project was created using Python using its random package.

Brief description of the game:
Hangman is a popular word game where players are given a word and they try to guess a correct letter in the
word for each try given with the aim of guessing the word before all their tries are finished. 

For this program, the random choice package selects a word from the word list created and the player has to try and guess the word letter by letter. If the player guesses an incorrect letter, a strike is made by essentially adding
body parts to create the "man". This is seen in a small visualization created in the program after each try. 

The more the player guesses letters that are not in the word, the closer the sketch of the "man" gets to become whole/complete. If the "man" is completed before the player guesses the word/inputs all the correct letters, they lose and the game ends. After this, the user is asked if they want to play a new game and if not, the program ends automatically.

How it works:
- Run the Hangman Minigame.py file.
- Follow the instructions that proceeds. Enjoy!!

Thank you for checking out this Hangman Minigame!!
